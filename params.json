{"name":"prettyping","tagline":"prettyping is a wrapper around the standard ping tool with the objective of making the output prettier, more colorful, more compact, and easier to read.","body":"Do you run `ping` tool very often? Do you find yourself squeezing your eyes to see if a packet has been lost? Do you want to have a better view of the latency and of the lost packets over time?\r\n\r\nThen `prettyping` is the tool for you!\r\n\r\n`prettyping` runs the standard `ping` in the background and parses its output, showing the ping responses in a *graphical* way at the terminal (by using colors and Unicode characters). Don't have support for UTF-8 in your terminal? No problem, you can disable it and use standard ASCII characters instead. Don't have support for colors? No problem, you can also disable them.\r\n\r\n`prettyping` is written in `bash` and `awk`, and should work out-of-the-box in most systems (Linux, BSD, Mac OS X, â€¦). It is self-contained in only one file, so it is trivial to install and run.\r\n\r\n## Quick install and run\r\n\r\n```\r\ncurl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denilsonsa/prettyping/master/prettyping\r\nchmod +x prettyping\r\n./prettyping whatever.host.you.want.to.ping\r\n```\r\n\r\n## What does it look like?\r\n\r\n![Animated GIF (4x the actual speed)](prettyping-4x.gif)\r\n\r\n[YouTube demonstration by Yu-Jie Lin](https://youtu.be/ziEMY1BcikM)\r\n\r\n<iframe width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/ziEMY1BcikM\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></iframe>\r\n\r\n## Comparison between tools\r\n\r\n|                      | [ping][iputils] | [mtr][] | prettyping |\r\n|----------------------|------|-----|------------|\r\n| Programming language | C | C | bash and awk |\r\n| How easy to install? | Should already come with your system | Medium (C compiler + root privileges) | Trivial (just one file) |\r\n| Requires root to install? | Yes (suid) | Yes (suid) | No (wrapper for ping, which is suid) |\r\n| How many hosts?      | One | All hosts in path | One |\r\n| Minimum ping interval | 0.2s for non-root users | 1.0s for non-root users | The same as ping |\r\n| How easy to read the latency? | Precise individual values are printed, average is only printed upon exit | Statistics for each host are updated on each response, plus a non-intuitive legend for the graph | Statistics for each host are updated on each response, plus an intuitive and colorful graph |\r\n| How easy to see lost packets? | Hard (lost packages aren't printed on the Linux `ping`) | Easy (`?` at the graphic, plus listed in the statistics) | Very easy (red `!` at the graphic, plus listed in the statistics) |\r\n| Statistics | Only shown upon exit | Updated in real-time, considers all responses since the beginning of the run | Updated in real-time, shows statistics for all responses since the beginning of the run, as well as statistics for the most recent 60 responses |\r\n| Redirecting output to file | Yes | No | Yes |\r\n| Terminal behavior | Standard output | Curses full-screen app | Standard output with optional colors and VT100 escapes |\r\n| Terminal dimensions | Ignores the terminal size | Reacts immediately to the terminal size | Adapts to the terminal size (only the future responses, the past responses are not changed) |\r\n\r\n## A bit of history\r\n\r\n`prettyping` was originally written in January of 2008, while I was working at [Vialink][]. I noticed that, very often, we were looking at the output of the ping tool to measure the quality of network links, by looking at a combination of packet loss ratio and latency. However, the standard ping output is too verbose, making it hard to have a quick glance at latency. Not just that, but missing/lost packets are not reported at all. Finally, the statistics of the run are only printed at the very end, after ping finishes running. This helpful piece of information should be available all the time.\r\n\r\nI observed a common use-case, a common pattern in our daily work, and I noticed that our workflow could have been improved by having better tools. And so I built a better tool. (By the way, this paragraph describes something I do ALL the time.)\r\n\r\nThus `prettyping` was born. And it received essentially no updates after 2008.\r\n\r\nIn October 2013, I discovered the [spark shell script in github][spark], which made me want to implement a similar output in `prettyping`. After a few days, I had implemented many features I wanted to implement for a long time, in addition to the spark-like output. After finishing all these features and polishing them, I submitted this tool to [reddit /r/linux][reddit1] and to [/r/commandline][reddit2] and received a lot of positive feedback.\r\n\r\nNow, this tool has its own repository, works on multiple `awk` implementations, works on Mac OS X (in addition to Linux), and even has packages for some Linux distros and for Mac OS X brew.\r\n\r\n## Other interesting projects\r\n\r\n* [mtr][] - Combines the functionality of the `traceroute` and `ping`, shows responses for all hosts in the path.\r\n* [oping][] - `liboping` is a C library to generate ICMP echo requests; `oping`, a tool that behaves just like the standard `ping`, but detects and prints missing responses, and also allows pinging multiple hosts simultaneously; `noping`, an ncurses interface with the same features as `oping`, but also highlighting the rtt value and showing live statistics.\r\n* [spark][] - Draws graphs in the shell using Unicode characters.\r\n\r\n[Vialink]: http://www.vialink.com.br/\r\n[spark]: https://github.com/holman/spark\r\n[reddit1]: https://www.reddit.com/r/linux/comments/1op98a/prettypingsh_a_better_ui_for_watching_ping/\r\n[reddit2]: https://www.reddit.com/r/commandline/comments/1oq5nz/prettypingsh_a_better_ui_for_watching_ping/\r\n[iputils]: http://www.skbuff.net/iputils/\r\n[mtr]: http://www.bitwizard.nl/mtr/\r\n[oping]: http://noping.cc/","google":"UA-47917227-1","note":"Don't delete this file!
